	<h2> 
	Experience </h2>
				
<p> I recently graduated from a Front-End Web Development course at General Assembly where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and how to be an awesome Front-End Web Developer! During my spare time, I enjoy senior water aerobics, pickling, and spending time with my goldfish, Jerry. </p> 
		
<h2> Relevant Experience </h2> 

<h3> Customer Support Trainer, Venmo 2015 – present </h3>
Built the customer supoprt training program from the ground up. Facilitated new hire training for the Chicago office and two outsource sites.
		
<h3> Caring Plant Mom, My home 2013 - present </h3> 
Sometimes plants die and that's okay. If you have a plant that needs help before you kill it I would gladly nurse it back to health for you. Plants want to live and grow and remind me to keep growing and keep going too. 

<h3> Tap Dancer and Free Spirit Apartment Dancer, 1993 - present </h3> 
My favorite creative outlet. I primarily live alone to faciliate regular dance parties with myself. I'm currently studying tap with Mark Yonally from Chicago Tap Theatre.
