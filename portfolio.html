	Experience </h2>
				
<p> I recently graduated from a Front-End Web Development course at General Assembly where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and how to be an awesome Front-End Web Developer! During my spare time, I enjoy senior water aerobics, pickling, and spending time with my goldfish, Jerry. </p>

<br>
Sometimes plants die and that's okay. If you have a plant that needs help before you kill it I would gladly nurse it back to health for you. Plants want to live and grow and remind me to keep growing and keep going too. 

<h3> Tap Dancer and Free Spirit Apartment Dancer, 1993 - present </h3>
